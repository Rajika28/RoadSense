# RoadSense

This repository contains scripts for performing traffic flow analysis using YOLOv8, an object-detection method, and ByteTrack, a simple yet effective online multi-object tracking method. It utilizes the Supervision package for various tasks such as tracking, annotations, etc.

The primary goal of this analysis is to detect and track vehicles in traffic scenarios, providing insights into traffic flow patterns and behaviors.

## üíª install

- clone repository and navigate to example directory

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Rajika28/RoadSense.git
  cd D:\RoadSense
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è script arguments

- ultralytics

  - `--source_weights_path`: Required. Specifies the path to the YOLO model's weights
    file, which is essential for the object detection process. This file contains the
    data that the model uses to identify objects in the video.

  - `--source_video_path`: Required. The path to the source video file that will be
    analyzed. This is the input video on which traffic flow analysis will be performed.
  - `--target_video_path` (optional): The path to save the output video with
    annotations. If not specified, the processed video will be displayed in real-time
    without being saved.
  - `--confidence_threshold` (optional): Sets the confidence threshold for the YOLO
    model to filter detections. Default is `0.3`. This determines how confident the
    model should be to recognize an object in the video.
  - `--iou_threshold` (optional): Specifies the IOU (Intersection Over Union) threshold
    for the model. Default is 0.7. This value is used to manage object detection
    accuracy, particularly in distinguishing between different objects.


## ‚öôÔ∏è run

- ultralytics

  ```bash

  --source_weights_path data/traffic_analysis.pt \
  --source_video_path data/traffic_analysis.mov \
  --confidence_threshold 0.3 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
